# minlist
## Backstory
minlist is basically a replica of craigslist. Hopefully, minlist has slightly better user interface. All buying and reselling websites today try too hard. They add unecessary features that you can simply do. A lot of the times, the company you are selling on takes a cut on what you make. So sad. We need more simple and blunt services like craigslist. Hopefully, minlist can be one of them too. 

The word "min" in minlist comes from the word minimal, which is the aim of this website. Craigslist focuses on so many things! My small brain can't keep track of it. minlist wants to only buy/trade and resell electronics and devices. So, when you use minlist, just know you're here for awesome gadgets!

## How to Use
Honestly, the website speaks for itself. You need an account, but you don't need your email to sign in. We don't want your information. We don't want to send you advertisments or promotions. With your account, you can browse electronics you may want to buy. Add to favorites, rate users, and more!
